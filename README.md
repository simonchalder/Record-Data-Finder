This is a simple application which will allow the user to discover detailed data about a record by inputting information into the app.

The application uses the Python Discogs Client to interact with the Discogs API

The application now uses a Tkinter GUI for better user usability

The user can now:

- Input the name of an artist and be presented with a list of releases by that artist

- Take the release number from the list of releases and search for information about that particular release

- Search immediately for a particular release if the number is known withut having to perform an artist search first

Data the app is currently able to provide about a particular release:

- Title

- Discogs.com url

- A list of tracks

- The format for that release

- Number for sale currently on Discogs.com

- The lowest price currently in $USD

- The year of the release

- The country of the release

- The record label catalogue number

Issues / still to-do:

Add more data fields such as info about the record label etc.

Aesthetic changes and improvements to the GUI

Testing
