This is a simple application which will allow the user to discover detailed data about a record by inputting information into the app.

The application uses the Python Discogs Client to interact with the Discogs API

Currently the app is console only but I will build a GUI with Tkinter or similar to provide better user usability.

Issues to be overcome:

Currently the results displayed do not differentiate between master releases and all releases
