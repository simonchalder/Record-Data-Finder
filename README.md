This is a simple application which will allow the user to discover detailed data about a record by inputting information into the app.

The application uses the Python Discogs Client to interact with the Discogs API

The application now uses a Tkinter GUI for better user usability

The user can now:

- input the name of an artist and be presented with a list of releases by that artist

- Take the release number from the list of releases and search for information about that particular release

- Search immediately for a particular release if the number is known withut having to perform an artist search first

Data the app is currently able to provide about a particular release:

- title

- Discogs.com url

- A list of tracks

- All formats for that release

- Number for sale currently on Discogs.com

- The lowest price currently in $US

- The year of the release

- The country of the release

- The record label catalogue number

Issues / still to-do:

Currently the results displayed do not differentiate between master releases and all releases

Add more data fields such as info about the record label etc.

Aesthetic changes and improvements to the GUI

Testing
